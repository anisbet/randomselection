Instructions for Running:
cat <list> ./randomselection.pl -s15 
 ./randomselection.pl -s15 -f"test_data.lst"

Product Description:
This script takes lines of text on STDIN or from a file if -f is used, and outputs a random 
selection of records to STDOUT. -s is the sample size in percent if the data is streaming
on STDIN and a absolute sample size if the input is from -f, because the total size of the file
is known, and a better dispersion of samples can be computed.

Perl script written by Andrew Nisbet for Edmonton Public Library, distributable by the enclosed license.
